## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- TailwindCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

With this project I reinforced my knowledge of how to manage forms with React, utilizing libraries such as Formik and Yup for validation. Additionally, managing the variables' states to show the previous or next step components was vital for making the multi-step work with a function that adds or subtracts the value representing the components. The use of different libraries and the development of a function to manage different components made this project a challenge and a great learning experience. In the end, I was able to deliver a multi-step form that was both user-friendly and functional.

### Continued development

I want to keep mastering Formik and Yup to make form validations as simple and effective as possible. This will help me to improve my web development skills and create better user experiences. I'm confident that with the help of Formik and Yup, I can create efficient and secure forms quickly and with ease. Additionally, at this point, I can handle TailwindCSS without major limitations. I'm now ready to begin working on more advanced projects that require Formik and Yup. I'm excited to take on the challenge of building more complex forms and creating even better user experiences.
